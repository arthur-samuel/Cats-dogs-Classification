# Cats vs Dogs Image Classification

## Overview

This project is an image classification task that utilizes machine learning to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled images of cats and dogs, and it can predict whether a given image contains a cat or a dog.

## Features

- **Binary Classification:** The model classifies images into two classes: "Cat" or "Dog."
- **TensorFlow Implementation:** The project uses the TensorFlow framework for building and training the neural network model.
- **Pre-trained Model:** You have the option to use a pre-trained model or train a new one from scratch based on your preferences and resources.
- **Easy to Use:** The code is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear instructions for running the code and making predictions on new images.
